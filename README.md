2048 Game
[DEMO LINK](https://kovaden414.github.io/2048-game/)

Project Overview
The 2048 Game project is a browser-based implementation of the popular puzzle game. Players combine tiles with the same number to create larger numbers, aiming to reach the elusive 2048 tile. The game includes a score tracker, visual feedback for win/loss states, and a responsive user interface. It is built without any frontend frameworks, focusing purely on clean JavaScript logic and dynamic DOM manipulation.

Features
- Keyboard Controls: Use arrow keys to move tiles up, down, left, or right.
- Dynamic Merging: Adjacent matching tiles merge and double their values.
- Random Tile Generation: A new tile (2 or 4) appears in a random empty cell after each move.
- Score Tracking: Real-time score updates based on tile merges.
- Game Status Messages: Displays game state messages like "Start", "You win!", and "You lose!".
- Restart Button: Restart the game at any time with the button.
